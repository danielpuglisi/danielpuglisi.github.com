    <p><strong>TL;DR: I hate it when I can&rsquo;t develop code in my favourite environment. So I found this glorious gem
called <a href="https://github.com/Shopify/shopify_theme">shopify_theme</a>
which automatically syncs shopify themes to your connected shop.</strong></p>




<p>I&rsquo;ve been lately working on a <a href="http://shopify.com">Shopify</a> store and the client who I work for
wishes a customized desgin which looks like their original website. I had to find out, that
this process wasn&rsquo;t that compatible with my expectation how to develop code
and Shopify&rsquo;s integrated webeditor.</p>




<p>Truth to be told, Shopify&rsquo;s online editor sucks (to be fair, every webeditor sucks when you wan&rsquo;t
to develop code with it). So I was looking for another solution. Shopify promotes that you can
develop templates with their <a href="http://wiki.shopify.com/Shopify_Textmate_Bundle">Textmate Bundle</a>.
Hmm no thank you&hellip; I didn&rsquo;t wanted to install Textmate only for developing one template.</p>




<p>Then there was this <a href="http://wiki.shopify.com/Theme_Sync_App">OSX App</a> which
I got recommended from the Shopify Support. You can download &amp; upload your themes with it but
the performance is terrible. Also a no go.</p>




<p>The final solution I came up with and using right now is this remarkably gem called
<a href="https://github.com/Shopify/shopify_theme">shopify_theme</a> from Shopify itself.
It can watch for changes on theme files and if it detects something, it automatically
syncs the files to the shop. I just ask myself why they don&rsquo;t list this gem anywhere.
Maybe I haven&rsquo;t searched enough.</p>




<p>Anyway. This is how I like to work. Thank you Shopify.</p>

    <p>Maybe you were in this situation before.
You&rsquo;re developing a website or
app with <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a> and using
a single <a href="http://www.heroku.com/">Heroku</a>
dyno to show off your current progress to your customers.
The thing is, if you are only
using one dyno for your app,
Heroku is going to put your app back to sleep after a
certain time (5 minutes I think?) and this causes your
app to load slower the next time a request comes in.
There <a href="https://github.com/github/hubot-scripts/blob/master/src/scripts/keep-alive.coffee">are</a>
<a href="http://beouk.blogspot.ch/2012/02/keeping-heroku-awake.html">a</a>
<a href="http://danneu.com/posts/7-keeping-that-free-heroku-dyno-alive-without-feeling-unethical">few</a>
workarounds already out there, but I wanted to have something simpler.</p>




<p>So I came up with a little shell script:</p>




<script src="https://gist.github.com/3490814.js?file=keep-alive.sh"></script>




<p>This script does nothing more than requesting every single Heroku app which is defined in the array at
the beginning of the script.</p>




<p>Of course, it would be a little bit overwhelming to call this script
every 5 minutes by hand, so we are going to create a cronjob.</p>




<p>To accomplish this, we are adding the following line to the <code>/etc/crontab</code> file:</p>




<script src="https://gist.github.com/3490792.js?file=crontab"></script>




<p>This is going to execute the <code>keep-alive.sh</code> script every minute.</p>




<p>To complete the whole thing, put the <code>keep-alive.sh</code> file into the <code>/etc/cron.custom</code> directory
(you may have to create the directory first) and you are all set.</p>




<p>I run that script on a Linux server, but it should also work with OSX.
And thats it. The Heroku app shouldn&rsquo;t go back to sleep anymore (as long as your system is running).</p>




<p>Enjoy.</p>
