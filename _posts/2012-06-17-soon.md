Tomorrow will be my last examination day and with this, the last day of my apprenticeship. Officially my apprenticeship lasts until the fifth of august, but it doesn't feel that way.

So unofficially, tomorrow at 16:15, European Time, GMT+ 1, I'll be a fresh baked computer scientist with the drive to destroy evil forces and donate bacon to the poor.

Last examination, I'm coming.
