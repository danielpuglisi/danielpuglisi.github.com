> These Days is about Connor Vast, a guy who designs fake computer interfaces for plastic prop displays in furniture showrooms. He meets a girl who doesn't own a cellphone and is as disconnected as he is connected. As their relationship develops, he falls in with a group of entrepreneurs out to invent the future, but it's the same future she's rebelling against. It's a story about the human side of technologyâ€”the people who make it, the reasons they build, and the people on the other end.
