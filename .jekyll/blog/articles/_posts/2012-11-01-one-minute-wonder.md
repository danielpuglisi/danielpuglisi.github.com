**One Minute Wonder** is a series of one minute video portraits of different people around the world. Artists, entrepreneurs, designers, rain-makers and other professions
are giving the world a little insight in their own life and world. I really like the idea behind it and I thought about doing this kind of short documentations on my own in
Switzerland. We'll see.
