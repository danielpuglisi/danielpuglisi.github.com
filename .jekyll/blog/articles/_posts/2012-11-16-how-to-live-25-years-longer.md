There are a lot of tips and how to's out there about how you can improve your lifestyle and maybe manage to live longer.
These tips often require more or less complex actions from us. From drinking one glas of wine per day
to changing your whole nutrition, you will find many instructions. And maybe if you do everything correctly and will not be hit by a car just on a random day,
you will manage to last a few years longer on this planet. Otherwise, all your actions will be worthless.
> there is always the risk to be by a bus on any day and all your actions will be worthless.

Today I want to give you a tip how you can extend your lifetime by 25 years. But in difference to these other
technqiues and tricks, you will not have to learn any complex actions nor pay any big amounts of money.
But I have to warn you in advance. This technique will not help you to live physically longer, say instead of 80 years you will live 85 years.
No, the amount of time you stay on this planet will be the same. What it will do is, it will extend your memories and experencies about 25 years.

Lets say, the ordinary lifespan of a human being in these modern days is 80 years. On average, one third of our entire life we spend in a state which is
called sleeping. Sleep is helping our body to regenerate energy, so that we are prepared for the next day. When we sleep, we also process the data
which we've recorded through the day and some of this data is processed during a special state of sleep which is called rapid eye movement (REM).
REM is the phase of sleep where dreams occur and most of the people have experienced it so far. Some of you maybe dream on a regular basis and some
of you will claim they had never dreamed in there entire life.
