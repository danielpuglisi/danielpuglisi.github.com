Working independantly and on a machine which is connected to the internet that provides thousands
and thousands hours of procrastinating stuff isn't always that easy. Sometimes you just drift off
of that new line of code you wanted to implement just because someone tweeted about this new fancy
piece of Apple device he or her just buyed. Several minutes elapse and you often don't even
remember how you ended up watching youtube videos in which unicorns and monkeys playing chess together.
You recognize that situation? Now don't be afraid, I'm here to help. I've 5 essentials tips for you
how you can prevent yourself from falling into this situation again.

### 1. Turn off vibration on your mobile phone

This one saved me a lot of time. Turn off vibration for the
most disturbing features/apps your phone possesses. In my case
I've disabled vibration for the following apps on my iPhone:

* SMS
* WhatsApp (I even disabled all notifications because of some group conversation I'm a member of)
* Mail
* Twitter
* Facebook
* Foursquare
* Instagram

I haven't disabled vibration when someone is calling me. When I don't want to be
disturbed by a phone call I put my iPhone into the **Do not disturb** mode. If your
phone doesn't possess such a feature you can of course disable the vibration for
the calling feature too.

### 2. The rule of three

The rule of three is one of my creations which helped me a lot lately. The basic idea
behind it is to have only three applications open at a time.
When I'm developing I only use a Terminal (iTerm) a Browser (Google Chrome) and a
music application (Spotify). Whereas the music application isn't work related but
has its own purpose (more about that in tip #3).
I know this isn't possible for every use case and if you need four applications
go along with four.

The value of doing this lies behind the number of open applications. It helps you
to recognize which apps are really supporting your workflow and which apps don't. Since
I'm using this approach I never got interrupted by a new Tweet or Chat message.

### 3. Wear headphones and listen to music

Wearing headphones can improve your productivity in two ways.

The first one is that people who are in the same room as you
(e.g. when you're working at a startup or in a coworking office)
don't just walk up to you and disturb you. The fact that you're
wearing headphones can be a sign that you are concentrating and don't want to be
interrupted. Unfortunately there are a lot of old school companies out there which
think you should not be listening to music on both ears, because if someone wants
to ask you a question from the other side of the room you don't hear them.
I think this is bullshit but you'll have to arrange it with the people you're
working with.

The second improvement is the music. Music can put you in a certain way of
consciousness which improves your concentration and speed on what you're working on
right now. I don't know if this is true for you,
but for me this effect only appears when I'm listening to music which have no
lyrics or vocals in it (there are of course a few exceptions).
Because of this I've created a [playlist](http://danielpuglisi.com/articles/2012/10/31/wiring-in.html) which I'm listening to when I'm programming
or writing blog articles (like this one).
But when you're listening to music while working, be sure that your music application (Spotify, iTunes or whatever) isn't disturbing you.
Hit the play button and then hide it somewhere where it doesn't come into your way.  
Another improvement here is,
that you don't have to listen to music you don't like (because you're wearing headphones).
Create your own playlist and if you want to and share it in the comments below.

### 4. Write a Todo list

Todo lists are essential to keep your productivity on a certain level. This tip is based on, that you already using Todo lists and should help
you to improve them. If you never used a Todo list here is a short
[introduction](http://codegestalt.com/fistbump/2012/04/04/four-productivity-hacks-you-should-use) (the chapter **Set weekly and daily goals** is what you're looking for).

After some time using Todo lists, you might find yourself not doing it on a daily basis anymore or maybe you just want to improve them a little bit more.
This list should bring you a step closer to your goal:

* Wrting Tasks down should be easy. You can only achieve this goal with the right collection of tools. I've used [Evernote]() a long time for my Todo lists but
in the end it wasn't the best tool for writing down and checking my tasks because it took to long.
At the moment I'm using good ol' pen and paper. I've buyed an moleskin notebook and always carry it with me when I have work todo. Maybe paper and pen isn't
the best solution for you, but what I want to say is, try different tools and find out what best fits you.
* Write everything down what you have done through the day even if it's not on the list. This approach is called the ToDone list. More [here](http://codegestalt.com/fistbump/2012/08/20/the-todone-list).
* Mark the three most important tasks of the day and do them right at the beginning of the day. Try to do these three tasks before the half time of your working day (normally lunch). If
these three tasks need more time split them into multiple tasks until you manage to them before your lunch. This will help you to improve your time management and
evaluate which tasks needs how much time.

### 5. Be disciplined

The last and most important lesson I want to give you in these 5 tips is about habits.
All these tips above will be useless (not necessarily applicable for tip #1 and #3) for you if you're not going
to use them on a regular basis. Which means every day. If you do them every day you can manage to build
up habits and the good thing about habits is, that you can't delete them. So once you have achieved to build
up habits for writing Todo lists everyday or checking how many applications are running on your computer before starting to work
you will manage to improve your productivity like never before. But from nothing comes nothing. So you need to discipline yourself.
If you don't have any problems with discipline yourself and don't need any help for that. Bravo. You can stop reading now
because then I belive you can apply the previous 4 tips without any problem. But if not, go on.
