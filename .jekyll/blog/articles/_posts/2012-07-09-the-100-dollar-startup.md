Daniel H. Pink, New York Times bestselling author of Drive and A Whole New Mind:

> The $100 Startup is a twofer: It's a kick in the pants to get started on your dream and a road map for finding your way once you begin. If you're not ready to launch your own business after reading this book, you need to go back and read it again!

That's the book I'm reading right now. Easy written, great tips, interesting stories.
