Avdi Grimm:

> So here it is: I’m stepping out into thin air and dedicating the bulk of my time to things that get me excited. I’ve been incredibly blessed so far in that my book sales have started to form a meaningful percentage (though not a majority) of my income. Now I’m going to see if doing what I love can actually support my family.

An interesting read up from Avdi Grimm about Avdi Grimm and his feelings about taking the step and being self-employed.
