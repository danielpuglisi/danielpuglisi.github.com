Some weird definition of **sharing is caring**:
    
> When you have something (usually food) and your friend wants some, its common to use this phrase.
>
> \*le you eating pizza while friend walks up\*  
> Them: Can I have some?  
> You: No.  
> Them: Sharing is caring!  
> You: I don't care.

Anyway, today I want to share some of my favourite movies and TV Series with you. Check out [this](/recommendations.html).
The list is sorted by Imdb ratings. Maybe I will add some books another day, but not now. If you have some stuff you want 
me to check out, please drop me a line. 

Thanks and enjoy &hearts;
