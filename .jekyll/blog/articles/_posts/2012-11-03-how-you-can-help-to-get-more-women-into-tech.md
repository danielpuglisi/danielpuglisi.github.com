> Here at codegestalt we often think about how we could get more people into Rails and programming in general. Online coding courses such as codecademy are basically non-existent in German speaking countries (it would make sense to take the course in English since the programming language uses English vocabulary anyway, but to some people it can still feel like another barrier to entry). So it makes sense to think about ways to solve that problem.

We need more women in tech. That's for sure. Women think about certain things in a whole different way than men. So we lose a lot
of knowledge, ideas and creativity because there aren't enough women around. This is bad and we need to fix that.

The idea behind the article above is very simple, but it isn't always that easy to get women into tech. One cool thing is, we all can help.
Everyone who works in tech has the possibility to pursuave their female friends
(yes, nerds also have women as friends, especially Ruby developers ;D) and introduce
them to the cool world of coding and creating.

So next time there is a Rails Girls event or something similar near you, share it with your friends, tell everyone about it
and try to get them onboard. And if there isn't any such event, why no start hosting it by yourself?
