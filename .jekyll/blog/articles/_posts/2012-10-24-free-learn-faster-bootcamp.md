Scott H Young:

> Here’s a brief outline of a few of the ideas I’m going to share for free over the next seven days:
> 
> * The exact time management system I used to complete the MIT Challenge
> * How to get through hundreds of pages of reading, without losing focus
> * Which note-taking technique you should use (and which common one you should never use)
> * The technique to boost your memory, so you remember content years after the class was taught
> * How to always have confidence before taking any exam
>
> Again this is completely FREE, but only to people on the email list.

Deal.
