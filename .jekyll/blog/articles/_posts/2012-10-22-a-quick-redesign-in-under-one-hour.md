I just redesigned my blog in under one hour. The changes contain simplier design, 
bigger headlines and more possibilites to format single elements like I want to
(Plus my face isn't watching you on every single page).

What do you think about the new design? Do you like it? What do you not like?
Questions about questions. Let me know in the comments.
