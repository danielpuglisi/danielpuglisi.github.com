Yo folks, sorry I haven't provided you with any new material the last days.
I was busy working with my G's on [Bridge](http://bridgetalks.ch). We held our first
Event and it was **f\**king** awesome (Don't know why I censor fuck). Check out the link
in the title for a really awesome talk you should watch. Additionally I'm working
on two new product ideas which I may share with you guys as soon as they take shape.
Until then, I keep hustling and you should too.

**Note:** Grammar Nazi may not approve but you know what?
