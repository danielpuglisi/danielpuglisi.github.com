![Rails Girls is coming to Basel, 5. - 6. April 2013!](/images/posts/rails-girls-basel.jpg)

Have you always wondered how to design and create
a homepage with your own hands?
Or maybe you had this fancy business idea
but didn't knew (or hadn't the money)
to realize your online presence?

Well then maybe Rails Girls is something for you. On the 5th and 6th April we will
unite at the mitte unternehmen and teach you how you can develop your very own
web applications. So, if you're a girl (sorry guys), have a MacBook/Laptop and
the drive to learn how to programm join us on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/RailsGirlsSwitzerland) and stay tuned.
We'll release the application form in the next few days.

Cheers.
