As you might know, I'm helping organizing the [Rails Girls Basel](http://railsgirls.com/basel) event which will take place on the 5th and 6th april this year.

To promote the event, we want to create a promo video and I had the idea to include several interviews from previous Rails Girls attendees/coaches from all over the world.
So if you're a former Rails Girls participant and would like to help me, here is what you can do:

* Record a video of yourself with the length of 30 - 60 seconds (it can be longer if you want to ;)
* Talk about the following topics in your video ["Why you are interested in programming?", "What do you like about programming?", "How is programming/tech related to your life?", "How has programming/tech changed your life?", "What do you think about the Rails Girls Event?", "What else do you want to say?"]
* Upload the whole thing to a server/dropbox
* Add a text file with your full name, Twitter handle and the city/country you live in
* Send me a link to the package, so I can download the whole thing, to this [address](daniel@codegestalt.com)

I would really appreciate your help and of course, you will be named in the credits.
Additionally if I can collect enough material, I'll try to create a general Rails Girls intro video which can be played on events all over the world :)

I'm awaiting your email, cheers &hearts;
