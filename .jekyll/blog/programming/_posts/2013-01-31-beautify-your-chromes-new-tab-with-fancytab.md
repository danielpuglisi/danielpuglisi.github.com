I had some spare time yesterday and decided to update and customize one of my favourite Chrome Extensions called VisivoTab.
What it does is, it just beautifies your Chrome's New Tab with a background image from flickr. I've updated that extension according
to the latest Chrome guidelines and customized it with my own flickr pictures.

You can download it [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/fancytab/nijnkhgjogmbghnbnfandncgdinihhab?hl=en).
Give it a try and rate it (with 5 stars ;). Enjoy &hearts;
