Me:

> But a todo list in itself isn't the whole truth in improving my speed and quality of getting things done. 
> Another important aspect is, that I have to see what I've done through the day. 
> Productivity isn't just a word or a feeling, for me it has to be visible. 

I just released a new article over at our company blog. It's about lists and stuff.
