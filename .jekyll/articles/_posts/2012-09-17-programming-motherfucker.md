I'm a big fan of the [Agile Software Development Manifesto](http://agilemanifesto.org/). 
I like the idea behind getting things done and collaborating with a client the whole
way down in a project. But to be honest, collaborating with clients needs time, a lot of
time. Sure, you want to give your clients a nice experience working with you and show
them what their possibilities are and whats the best solution for them. 

But as I said, that needs time.
And that time costs your customers money, and if you are honest, most of the time you already know
what's best for them. The thing that really needs time is to convince them to use the best solution. 
Because most of the clients don't know what they want or need. 

And this is where the **Programming, Motherfucker** Manifesto comes in. The idea behind it is to
throw unnecessary weight overboard and concentrate on the real shit: **Programming**.

For instance: In the example above, don't collaborate to much with your clients. Say them what you think
is best for them and don't let yourself control by the fear that you could loose those clients. You
are the specialist. The man with expertise. You, and only you know what's the best solution for their problem. So tell them and sell them.
And if they don't want you anymore, that's good for you. Because you don't have to waste your time on things you are not passionate about.
You can save that time for clients you like to work for, for clients which will appreciate your knowledge, for
clients which will enjoy that you deliver instead of just talking.

So lets get started and do some **Programming, Motherfucker**.
