Nick:

> When I started my on-call shifts, we had pretty little in the way of automation for day-to-day issues. Tasks like SSH’ing into our cluster, starting a Rails console, or doing a deep search through our gigantic mail directories, were either shelved away in someone’s bashrc, history log, or just ingrained into someone’s memory. This pain was also felt by a few other of my fellow programmers, and we started cobbling together a Git repo simply named “37s shell scripts”.

We had something similiar in mind for our Codegestalt environment and **[sub](https://github.com/37signals/sub)**
looks like a good solution to start instead of doing everything from scratch.
