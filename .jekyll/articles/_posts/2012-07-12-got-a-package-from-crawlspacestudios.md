"Honey, don't do it! Please! Please don't! Noooooooo!", screamed my old MacBook Mid 2008, as I clicked on the 
"Order Now" button to buy the new [MacBook Pro with Retina Display](http://www.apple.com/macbook-pro/), slowly but surely knowing that his time has 
come to move along.

In fact, I needed a new MacBook. 

> Okay, to correct me, I still need one... It's been 4 weeks now since I ordered that shiny new machine from Apple.
  But at least I got a message today that my order has been shipped. So hopefully it doesn't take to much time from now on...

And to take that new 15" device with me, I also needed a suitable bag for it. So there is this new online ecommerce
platform designer thing, what's his name... ah ja, [Etsy](http://etsy.com). And on this Etsy thing, there are thousands
and thousands of designer shops from independant designers and cool people. So I roughly spend 3 hours searching for 
a messenger bag that looks cool and has enough space for a 15" MacBook. I found a lot of really nice stuff and shops
and in the end I've chosen [this](http://www.etsy.com/listing/96111239/picassos-guernica-screen-printed) wonderful
item to stick with me for the next few years. The heads behind that bag are Kevin and Ginny from [CrawlSpaceStudios](http://www.etsy.com/shop/CrawlSpaceStudios).
A big THANK YOU to them for making that bag, I really like it.

Ah, and I also buyed a tshirt from them. You can take a look at that hilarious stuff in the picture below.
