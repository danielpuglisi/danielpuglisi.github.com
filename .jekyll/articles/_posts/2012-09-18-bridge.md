I'm happy to announce, that the first Bridge event will take place at the 3rd october at the mitte enterprise in Basel.
For this occasion we've updated the [Bridge page](http://bridgetalks.ch) to give you a little insight of the venue
and the first speakers which will attend at the 3rd october. 

The idea behind Bridge is to get people from different industries together and let them discover new and exciting stuff.
We will start at 7pm and each talk will take about 20 minutes. After the talks you will get the chance to get in touch
with the speakers and the other attendees to discuss the main topics or other stuff. Or maybe you will just let the evening wind
down with a refreshing [**Unser Bier**](http://www.unser-bier.ch/) at the mitte bar. It's your call.

Anyway. We would be happy to see you at the 3rd october. And if you have a second, please tell your friends about Bridge. We
love you &hearts;
