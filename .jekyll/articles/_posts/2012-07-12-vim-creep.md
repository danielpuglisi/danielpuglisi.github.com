Rudis Muiznieks:

> Staying late one night to finish an assignment that was due at midnight, you happened to catch a glimpse over one of the quiet uber-programmer's shoulders. Your eyes twinkled from the glow of rows upon rows of monitors in the darkened computer lab as you witnessed in awe the impossible patterns of code and text manipulation that flashed across the screen.

>  "How did you do that?" you asked, incredulous.

>  The pithy, monosyllabic answer uttered in response changed your life forever: "Vim."

Fresh story about the lifecycle of a Vim user. Reminds me of myself.
