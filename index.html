    <p>Some weird definition of <strong>sharing is caring</strong>:</p>




<blockquote><p>When you have something (usually food) and your friend wants some, its common to use this phrase.</p>

<p>*le you eating pizza while friend walks up*<br/>
Them: Can I have some?<br/>
You: No.<br/>
Them: Sharing is caring!<br/>
You: I don&rsquo;t care.</p></blockquote>




<p>Anyway, today I want to share some of my favourite movies and TV Series with you. Check out <a href="/recommendations.html">this</a>.
The list is sorted by Imdb ratings. Maybe I will add some books another day, but not now. If you have some stuff you want
me to check out, please drop me a line.</p>




<p>Thanks and enjoy &hearts;</p>

    <p>I&rsquo;m happy to announce, that the first Bridge event will take place at the 3rd october at the mitte enterprise in Basel.
For this occasion we&rsquo;ve updated the <a href="http://bridgetalks.ch">Bridge page</a> to give you a little insight of the venue
and the first speakers which will attend at the 3rd october.</p>




<p>The idea behind Bridge is to get people from different industries together and let them discover new and exciting stuff.
We will start at 7pm and each talk will take about 20 minutes. After the talks you will get the chance to get in touch
with the speakers and the other attendees to discuss the main topics or other stuff. Or maybe you will just let the evening wind
down with a refreshing <a href="http://www.unser-bier.ch/"><strong>Unser Bier</strong></a> at the mitte bar. It&rsquo;s your call.</p>




<p>Anyway. We would be happy to see you at the 3rd october. And if you have a second, please tell your friends about Bridge. We
love you &hearts;</p>

    <p>Dear lovely people of the world. I have to tell you something. I love listening to music.
Without music, my life wouldn&rsquo;t be the same, I wouldn&rsquo;t be the same. I listening to a lot of music
and that means I listening to many different artists, to many different lyrics,
to many different tunes and to many different genres. And once in a while I stumble across something special,
something that I like from the first few seconds on, something that moves me, something that doesn&rsquo;t let
me sleep and I need to listen to it before I can dive into the land of dreams.</p>




<p>This week I found such a gem. The band is called <strong>Daughter</strong>. I can&rsquo;t get enough of the beautiful
and strong melodies, the soft and lovely voice and the stunning and dramatic lyrics.</p>




<p>But enough from me. The best thing I can do right now is to show you a live session from their song <strong>Youth</strong>.
Turn up the volume. Eliminate all background noises. Press play on the video below. Enter full screen mode. Enjoy.</p>

<p>Ramiro Gómez created a graph which shows the different influences of programming languages.
In the image above, you can see how Ruby was influenced (red lines) by Python or C++ and influenced (blue lines)
languages like CoffeeScript or Windows PowerShell.</p>

      </h2>
      <div class="meta">September  7, 2012</div>
    </header>
    <p><strong>TL;DR: I hate it when I can&rsquo;t develop code in my favourite environment. So I found this glorious gem
called <a href="https://github.com/Shopify/shopify_theme">shopify_theme</a>
which automatically syncs shopify themes to your connected shop.</strong></p>




<p>I&rsquo;ve been lately working on a <a href="http://shopify.com">Shopify</a> store and the client who I work for
wishes a customized desgin which looks like their original website. I had to find out, that
this process wasn&rsquo;t that compatible with my expectation how to develop code
and Shopify&rsquo;s integrated webeditor.</p>




<p>Truth to be told, Shopify&rsquo;s online editor sucks (to be fair, every webeditor sucks when you wan&rsquo;t
to develop code with it). So I was looking for another solution. Shopify promotes that you can
develop templates with their <a href="http://wiki.shopify.com/Shopify_Textmate_Bundle">Textmate Bundle</a>.
Hmm no thank you&hellip; I didn&rsquo;t wanted to install Textmate only for developing one template.</p>




<p>Then there was this <a href="http://wiki.shopify.com/Theme_Sync_App">OSX App</a> which
I got recommended from the Shopify Support. You can download &amp; upload your themes with it but
the performance is terrible. Also a no go.</p>




<p>The final solution I came up with and using right now is this remarkably gem called
<a href="https://github.com/Shopify/shopify_theme">shopify_theme</a> from Shopify itself.
It can watch for changes on theme files and if it detects something, it automatically
syncs the files to the shop. I just ask myself why they don&rsquo;t list this gem anywhere.
Maybe I haven&rsquo;t searched enough.</p>




<p>Anyway. This is how I like to work. Thank you Shopify.</p>
