    <p>4 years ago I was pleasantly surprised after I&rsquo;ve watched that random movie I&rsquo;d buyed from my local DVD supplier.
90 minutes full of action and a plot which was unexpected intense and gripping. Where I live, they call this movie 96 hours.
The world maybe better knows it under the name of <strong>Taken</strong>.</p>




<p>This week I saw the sequel. And believe me when I say that this film is one of the worst productions Hollywood came up with this year.
The dialogues are poor, the action scenes are lame and the whole plot is filled with weird shit which is going on. Like an untrained girl
throwing grenades through Istanbul or a revenge seeking father who doesn&rsquo;t care about that his son was a female trader.</p>




<p>But lets talk about the good things: Liam Neeson is still a good actor and he did a good job. At least that good as you can get it out of the script.
Because he can&rsquo;t do anything about a bad written story or the weird movements of the camera man, he&rsquo;s just an actor.
So he is innocent when you start thinking that he can kill people by simply grabbing them into the face.
Maybe Luc Besson thought Chuck Norris is looking for a replacment?</p>




<p>So the conclusion for you is: <strong>Don&rsquo;t watch Taken 2</strong>. Go watch <strong>Looper</strong> or <strong>Savages</strong>.
I haven&rsquo;t saw them yet, but I&rsquo;m one hundred percent sure that these movies aren&rsquo;t the same waste of time as Taken 2 was.</p>




<p>But</p>

<p>about bad sequels.</p>




<p>One week ago I secretly <a href="http://danielpuglisi.com/articles/2012/10/10/html5-fullscreen-api-attack.html">ranted</a> about Microsoft.
One day later I got a present from <a href="https://twitter.com/yve_cab">@yve_cab</a>, Microsoft cereals:</p>




<p><img src="/images/posts/ms-cereals-01.jpg" alt="Bild 1" /></p>




<p><img src="/images/posts/ms-cereals-02.jpg" alt="Bild 2" /></p>




<p><img src="/images/posts/ms-cereals-03.jpg" alt="Bild 3" /></p>




<p>What comes around, goes around. Good move there broham :D</p>




<p>I haven&rsquo;t tried them yet but they do look tasty.
Maybe Microsoft should left the Software industry behind and start selling cereals as their main focus.</p>

<blockquote><p>My little cousin decided to dress up as Woody from Toy Story for Halloween this year. After finding the perfect version of that costume from the Disney Store, his mom had it shipped to the office since we didn’t know exactly what time it would arrive in the day. When it got here, the words “Love – Andy” was written in marker on the outside by someone from the Disney Store team.</p></blockquote>




<p>Cool idea.</p>

<blockquote><p>This is a neat little trick that I stumbled upon when play­ing around with a CSS exper­i­ment a few months ago. Basically, by using mul­tiple box-shadows, you can draw com­plex images with only a single ele­ment. As you may know, I’m a big fan of semantic markup, and I really don’t like using extra ele­ments just for styl­ing, so I was very happy with this discovery!</p></blockquote>




<p>Nice trick!</p>

<blockquote><p>Links are the bread and butter of the web. People click links all day long — people are pretty trained to think that clicking a link on the web is safe. Saavy users may check the link’s destination in the status bar before clicking, however, in this case it won’t do them any good.</p></blockquote>




<p>Additional security tips:</p>




<ul>
<li>Don&rsquo;t use Internet Explorer, download a better browser <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/">here</a></li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t use Windows, download or buy a better OS <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/">here</a> or <a href="http://www.apple.com/osx/">here</a></li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t use Microsoft products at all, they are shitty anyway</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t listen to people who say &ldquo;people who say Microsoft is shit have no idea&rdquo;</li>
<li>Read <a href="http://www.vanwensveen.nl/rants/microsoft/IhateMS_1.html">this</a> article and share it with your friends</li>

<p><strong>By the way</strong>: I don&rsquo;t like Microsoft</p>

<blockquote><p>When I started my on-call shifts, we had pretty little in the way of automation for day-to-day issues. Tasks like SSH’ing into our cluster, starting a Rails console, or doing a deep search through our gigantic mail directories, were either shelved away in someone’s bashrc, history log, or just ingrained into someone’s memory. This pain was also felt by a few other of my fellow programmers, and we started cobbling together a Git repo simply named “37s shell scripts”.</p></blockquote>




<p>We had something similiar in mind for our Codegestalt environment and <strong><a href="https://github.com/37signals/sub">sub</a></strong>
looks like a good solution to start instead of doing everything from scratch.</p>

    <p>Yo folks, sorry I haven&rsquo;t provided you with any new material the last days.
I was busy working with my G&rsquo;s on <a href="http://bridgetalks.ch">Bridge</a>. We held our first
Event and it was <strong>f**king</strong> awesome (Don&rsquo;t know why I censor fuck). Check out the link
in the title for a really awesome talk you should watch. Additionally I&rsquo;m working
on two new product ideas which I may share with you guys as soon as they take shape.
Until then, I keep hustling and you should too.</p>
