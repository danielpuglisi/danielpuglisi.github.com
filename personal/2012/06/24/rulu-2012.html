    <p>So Rulu 2012 is over and to say it right ahead: for me, it was just awesome! It was my first (ruby) developer conference at all and I could really benefit from it.</p>

<p>The organisers of the event have done a very great job. From the introduction, to the talks. From the food (the food was actually pretty awesome!) to the party.
I have experienced/contributed to/organized a lot of events (from small to big events) and I can say this one went very well. So congratulations to the organisers.</p>

<p>Beside the great talks I&rsquo;ve listened to, I&rsquo;ve also met a lot of interesting and great ruby developers.
I have gained so much inspiration and discovered a lot of new stuff that I&rsquo;m definitely going to try out in the next few days or weeks (vim plugins, books, databases and a tons of tools). And I think I finally found my Harajuku moment for
starting to learn TDD (yap, I haven&rsquo;t used TDD yet, shame on me). So I can&rsquo;t wait to come back home and start to learn anything about rspec and any other test related stuff.</p>

<p>I also want to add that it was a great experience for me to test my English knowledge that I had accomplished the last few years in school and I think I actually did quite well.
In that short time of speaking to other people, it gave me a huge boost of self-confidence and I think if you are in a similiar position as I am you should definitely check out some
local or near events where the attendees only speak the language you want to improve. For sure, it needs a lot of courage to talk to foreign people but in the end you only can win.
So a big &ldquo;Thank you&rdquo; to every French attendee for speaking English (in Switzerland, the most French people I know don&rsquo;t like and are not going to talk to you in English or German,
so it&rsquo;s quite difficult to communicate with them. But that&rsquo;s just my experience, please correct me if I&rsquo;m wrong). Because otherwise I wouldn&rsquo;t have understand anything
except of &ldquo;bonjour&rdquo;, &ldquo;bonsoir&rdquo; or &ldquo;bon appetit&rdquo;.</p>

<p>But enough from my blabla. I have taken a few pictures through the conference and I will just let the pictures speak for themselves:</p>

<p>If you are interested in the talks, I think the Rulu organisators are creating videos
from the presentations. As soon as they are available, I&rsquo;ll post the link in this blog.</p>

    <b>Hint</b>: I'm not a native English speaker, 
    so I would really appreciate it if you
    would drop me a quick message via twitter or mail 
    if you find something that I've spelled/done wrong.
    You will find the contact information on the left side.
    Thanks.
