&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;So here it is: I’m stepping out into thin air and dedicating the bulk of my time to things that get me excited. I’ve been incredibly blessed so far in that my book sales have started to form a meaningful percentage (though not a majority) of my income. Now I’m going to see if doing what I love can actually support my family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An interesting read up from Avdi Grimm about Avdi Grimm and his feelings about taking the step and being self-employed.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;A hustler is someone who is single minded in his quest to get results. Nothing else motivates him. Nothing else matters. To hustle you have to think big picture and you have to be driven by creating significant results for your venture. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter if it&amp;rsquo;s closing deals or closing a round of funding &amp;ndash; a startup hustler gets things done that drive revenue for the company and that are crucial for survival and for growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also have one of these &amp;ldquo;Startup Hustlers&amp;rdquo;. Let me introduce to you: &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/freshfey&quot;&gt;@freshfey&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>Rulu 2012</title>
   <link href="http://danielpuglisi.com/personal/2012/06/24/rulu-2012.html"/>
   <updated>2012-06-24T00:00:00+02:00</updated>
   <id>http://danielpuglisi.com/personal/2012/06/24/rulu-2012</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;So Rulu 2012 is over and to say it right ahead: for me, it was just awesome! It was my first (ruby) developer conference at all and I could really benefit from it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The organisers of the event have done a very great job. From the introduction, to the talks. From the food (the food was actually pretty awesome!) to the party.
I have experienced/contributed to/organized a lot of events (from small to big events) and I can say this one went very well. So congratulations to the organisers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beside the great talks I&amp;rsquo;ve listened to, I&amp;rsquo;ve also met a lot of interesting and great ruby developers.
I have gained so much inspiration and discovered a lot of new stuff that I&amp;rsquo;m definitely going to try out in the next few days or weeks (vim plugins, books, databases and a tons of tools). And I think I finally found my Harajuku moment for
starting to learn TDD (yap, I haven&amp;rsquo;t used TDD yet, shame on me). So I can&amp;rsquo;t wait to come back home and start to learn anything about rspec and any other test related stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also want to add that it was a great experience for me to test my English knowledge that I had accomplished the last few years in school and I think I actually did quite well.
In that short time of speaking to other people, it gave me a huge boost of self-confidence and I think if you are in a similiar position as I am you should definitely check out some
local or near events where the attendees only speak the language you want to improve. For sure, it needs a lot of courage to talk to foreign people but in the end you only can win.
So a big &amp;ldquo;Thank you&amp;rdquo; to every French attendee for speaking English (in Switzerland, the most French people I know don&amp;rsquo;t like and are not going to talk to you in English or German,
so it&amp;rsquo;s quite difficult to communicate with them. But that&amp;rsquo;s just my experience, please correct me if I&amp;rsquo;m wrong). Because otherwise I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have understand anything
except of &amp;ldquo;bonjour&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;bonsoir&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;bon appetit&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But enough from my blabla. I have taken a few pictures through the conference and I will just let the pictures speak for themselves:&lt;/p&gt;

   <title>We are going to France</title>
   <link href="http://danielpuglisi.com/personal/2012/06/18/we-are-going-to-france.html"/>
   <updated>2012-06-18T00:00:00+02:00</updated>
   <id>http://danielpuglisi.com/personal/2012/06/18/we-are-going-to-france</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Yes, thats true. We are going to France. &lt;a href=&quot;http://rodrigohaenggi.com&quot;&gt;Rodrigo&lt;/a&gt; and I.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But before I&amp;rsquo;m going to reveal the reason why we are visiting France, I want to tell you the story of a little boy:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The story is about a little boy who tried very hard to learn French the last six years, but wasn&amp;rsquo;t very successful. Truth be told, he sucked at French.
Very often that boy thought about the reason why he was so bad at it. He asked himself wether the reason was his learning method?
Did he spend to little time on cramming specific words or grammar rules? Or did he just sucked in languages?
He started to dig around in his past and found out, that his marks at the elementary school were quite good and the French mark was around a 5 (A-). So he moved on with his thoughts and landed at the
secondary school. And that was the time were his French mark jumped off the top of a high-rise without attracting a lifeline. His mark dropped to a 1 (F) in the second semester of the secondary school.
First he thought the reason for this were just his puberty. But after thinking a little bit longer about it, he realized that the main reason for his situation laid elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason was his former class teacher. Everything he had done, at the time back then, was presented by the teacher as poor. An example was, that the teacher humiliated him because of his
handwriting and gave him bad marks because of it.
So he began to train his handwriting skills, but it was never good enough. Everything he tried got restrained by this teacher. So he gave up.
After the second semester he switched the class and his mark got a little bit better, but he never reached the same level that he had before.
And even yet, he always has a bad feeling when he is hearing the French langauge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a few years that teacher got kicked out of school because of bullying students.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also suck at French. I don&amp;rsquo;t know why. Maybe it is because of such a shitty teacher or because I didn&amp;rsquo;t learned enough for school. Maybe I will never know. But what I do know is,
that this teacher from the story is an old fat wanker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But back to the topic of this post. We are going to France. To be more specific, we are going to Lyon. The reason for this is the &lt;a href=&quot;http://rulu.eu/&quot;&gt;Ruby Lugdunum&lt;/a&gt; conference.
Rodrigo and I are passionate Ruby developers and I think we can learn much from the talks and the people we are going to meet there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope they speak English there and if not I do remeber a few words in French:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Excuse moi, je suis un tourist.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
